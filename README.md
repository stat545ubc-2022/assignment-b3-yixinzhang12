Link to my dashboard: https://hfjtl7-yixin0zhang.shinyapps.io/assignment-b3-yixinzhang12/

I made the following modification to the BC Liquor Store Price Shiny App shared in the lecture:

1. I added an option to arrange table from lowest to highest prices;

2. I added a line at the top of the main panel showing the number of results; 

3. I added the option to choose multiple types of liquor at once;

4. I tested the app and made sure no red error message is shown when no entry was selected in the "Type" checkboxes.
